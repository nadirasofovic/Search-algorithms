# Search Algorithms

**Search Algorithms** is a collection of various search algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages, designed to efficiently solve problems involving finding an element or a group of elements in a dataset. These algorithms are fundamental for computer science and are used in various applications such as databases, routing, AI, and more.

This repository includes implementations of both **unsorted** and **sorted** search algorithms, providing insights into their time complexities and trade-offs.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Search**: A basic algorithm that checks each element of the dataset sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted dataset by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Jump Search**: A faster algorithm that works by jumping ahead a fixed number of elements.
- **Exponential Search**: A combination of binary search and linear search to quickly locate an element in a sorted array.
- **Interpolation Search**: A modification of binary search that estimates where the target value might be based on the current element.

## Features

- **Multiple Language Implementations**: The algorithms are implemented in multiple languages such as Python, Java, and C++.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each algorithm is accompanied by comments and explanations to help you understand the logic and the time complexity.
- **Time Complexity Comparison**: A comparison of the time complexities of various algorithms, helping you understand which algorithm is more efficient for a particular dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing search algorithms in a high-level language.
- **Java**: For providing a widely-used, object-oriented implementation.
- **C++**: For showcasing the algorithms in a more performance-focused language.
